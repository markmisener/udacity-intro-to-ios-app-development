## Udacity: Become an iOS developer


### PitchPerfect
This app is was built by following Udacity's free [Intro to iOS App Development with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ios-app-development-with-swift--ud585) course.

Ever wondered what you’d sound like as a Chipmunk or Darth Vader? Wonder no more! In this first project, you’ll build an app that records a user’s voice and then plays the modulated audio through a variety of filters.

### MemeMe
This app is was built by following Udacity's free [UIKit Fundamentals](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud788) course.

Solidify your knowledge of iOS user interface concepts by building an app that creates memes from images! The project is split into two parts. In part 1, you’ll create an app that enables the user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share the meme with friends. In part 2, you’ll display sent memes in both a table and collection view.

### On the Map
This app is was built by following Udacity's free [iOS Networking with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-networking-with-swift--ud421) course.

By incorporating networking, apps truly become “mobile” -- interacting with interesting data using popular web services. In this project, you’ll build your first networked app that displays information posted by other Udacity students. You’ll create a map view with pins representing student locations, and by tapping a pin, the app will display a custom URL posted by a student.
